         <h3>The power of Uknown(q1)</h3>
         <p>My story will start with a strange question,Why things we see appear to us as they do?</p>
      </div>
      <div>

      <div class="panel two">
                <p>The whole notion of “appearing” seems problematic. On one hand it is obvious that
  things appear to us the way they do because, barring illusions, that’s the way they are! On the other hand, it is
  also clear that a particular thing being the way it is, is neither necessary nor sufficient for our seeing it the
  way we do. We know that things can look quite different to us in different circumstances and perhaps they
  do look different to others. So it is not unreasonable for us to ask what is responsible for our seeing things as
  we do, as opposed to seeing them in some other way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel three">
         <h2>Things to consider in benefit of living with fewer possessiveness resulting to future goals.</h2><p>(I.) More freedom:The accumulation of stuff is like an anchor, it ties us down. We are always terrified of losing all our ‘stuff’. Let it go and you will experience a freedom like never before: a freedom from greed, debt, obsession and overworking.</p>
          <p>(II.) Create room for whats important:When we purge our junk drawers and closets we create space and peace. We lose that claustrophobic feeling and we can actually breathe again. Create the room to fill up our lives with meaning instead of stuff.</p>
          <p>(III.) Less focus on materialic products:All the stuff we surround ourselves with is merely a distraction, we are filling a void. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy comfort. After the initial comfort is satisfied, that’s where our obsession with money should end.We are bombarded by the media presenting promises of happiness through materialistic measures. It’s no wonder we struggle everyday. Resist those urges. It’s an empty path, it won’t make you happy.It’s hard not to get roped into the consumerism trap. I need constant reminders that it’s a false sense of happiness. I enjoy stuff, but I also recognize that I don’t need it.</p>
          <p>(IV.) Peace of mind:When we cling onto material possessions we create stress because we are always afraid of losing these things. By simplifying your life you can lose your attachment to these things and ultimately create a calm, peaceful mind.The less things you have to worry about, the more peace you have, and it’s as simple as that.</p>
          <p>(V.) More happiness:When de-cluttering your life, happiness naturally comes because you gravitate towards the things that matter most. You see clearly the false promises in all the clutter, it’s like a broken shield against life’s true essence.</p>
