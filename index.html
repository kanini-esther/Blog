                <p>(II.) Create room for whats important:When we purge our junk drawers and closets we create space and peace. We lose that claustrophobic feeling and we can actually breathe again. Create the room to fill up our lives with meaning instead of stuff.</p>

          <p>(III.) Less focus on materialic products:All the stuff we surround ourselves with is merely a distraction, we are filling a void. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy comfort. After the initial comfort is satisfied, that’s where our obsession with money should end.We are bombarded by the media presenting promises of happiness through materialistic measures. It’s no wonder we struggle everyday. Resist those urges. It’s an empty path, it won’t make you happy.It’s hard not to get roped into the consumerism trap. I need constant reminders that it’s a false sense of happiness. I enjoy stuff, but I also recognize that I don’t need it.</p>

By simplifying your life you can lose your attachment to these things and ultimately create a calm, peaceful mind.The less things you have to worry about, the more peace you have, and it’s as simple as that.</p>
          <p>(V.) More happiness:When de-cluttering your life, happiness naturally comes because you gravitate towards the things that matter most. You see clearly the false promises in all the clutter, it’s like a broken shield against life’s true essence.</p>

             <h4>Leadership</h4>
             <p>By listening to young people in an open and supportive context, by seeking to learn from
               their associations and their expectations and ideologies, we can identify the potential sites for
               such militant movements—and the causes that give rise to them. For the most part, what we
               hear from the bewildered young men and women who have been caught up in armed groups,
               is that they aspire to conventional forms of modernity: an education, a job, and a family.
               Many also have dreams of pursuing social justice and development, eradicating corruption and fulfilling the promises of liberation. </p>

          <h2>The Human Spirit: When Tragedy Strikes</h2>
          <p> Throughout history, the human race has always been resilient in every tragedy that has ever struck us throughout history. </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>Famines, not one but two world wars, Nuclear war, The Spanish flu, Drought, Terrorist attacks, recession and now, A world wide pandemic: Coronavirus, or as its more commonly known: COVID-19</p>
          <p> 2020 has been the year of absolute chaos, I should have known from the very moment we lost legendary basketball player, Kobe Bryant, it was going to be a bad year.</p>
          <p>Across the pond in Wuhan, China, the disease was starting to spread into other cities in the country. </p>
          <p>Most of the world leaders seemed to sweep it under the rug and labeled it as a 'none issue' or better yet as President Trump so eloquently put it 'China Virus'</p>
          <p>As the weeks passed, the highly contagious strain of coronavirus made its way out of main land China and made its way across the world. Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, North and South America. To say the world wasn't prepared for a pandemic, is an understatement.</p>
          <b></b>
          <p> As the governments look for solution to keep their respective countries afloat and try to stop the curve the world in some ways came into a standstill. Curfews were implemnted in almost all countries with positive cases. </p>
          <p> One thing that disrupts the notion of change was widely encoraged. History more or less always repeats itself. During the 80's, when the first cases of HIV/AIDS started getting recorded and published. The positive cases mostly came from gay men. There was such a huge stigma behind Aids - which still exists to this day and age. Learning from the past in someways, we started showing individuals there is nothing wrong with getting it, which in turn made people ge tested.  </p>
          <b></b>
          <p>As the world comes together to look for the cure for this disease, we realize time awaits no man. The world moves on, we realize, time waits for no one. People aren't going to sit back and watch their children go hungry. We have to look for ways to adapt and deal with the cards we were left to deal with. The world's way of adapting became turning everything virtual.</p>       
          <p>The world as we knew it, is gone. A few factors became uknown. The world was in free fall. How the world begun changing : </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> We're about six months into the pandemic and we've figured out how to do the same things we were doing everything we were doing pre-covid 19 sans afew things but it seems to be working adequately so far. </p>
          <p> Schools, Work, Social Interaction, while nothing can replace human contact, Through technology, we're able to move forward with our lives in some aspects. Albeit challenging but we're moving forward with the situation that's been introduced to us. We have no other option but deal with what's ahead. Turning lemons into lemonade as so the saying goes. </p>

              <h3>Colonialism</h3>
              <p>The world changed completely once colonisation struck. It's ironic that the nation that did all the atrocities that came with colonisation. </p>
              <p> Some advantages include Religion: colonilism has helped to spread religion especially the Christian religion. The Europeans missionaries brought Christian religions to their colonies and taught the people of the colonies the religion quite well. The christian religion remains one of the biggest religion of the continent.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest disadvantages was the colonial master's aim. Which was to exploit our motherland and use the acquired resources to build they're colonies and countries. </p>
              <p>The worst disadvantage I would say would be the lack regard for african human lives. Our forfathers and ancestors were treated with. Animals were treated better than african, only to be slaves for over 400 years in a foreign land and being disconnected from they're roots. </p>
              <b></b>
              <p>Far more disadvantages came from colonisation than advatages. One of the biggest take aways from the tragedy was how much was bore out of that pain. </p>
              <p>Black innovators and black culture has changed the world. A culture was bore from such pain and changed the world. Some notable inventions include traffic lights, ironing boards, the light buld , the cotton gin, one of the most impactful events: A black woman solved the math that was needed to get America to the moon. One of the world's history defining moments happened all because of a black woman. </p>
